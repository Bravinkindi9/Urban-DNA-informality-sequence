# Project Illiya: Morphological Fingerprinting of Urban Informality

### The Objective
To map urban settlement formality (Informal, Planned Residential, Large Formal Infrastructure) at scale across sub-Saharan Africa. This project abandons the dominant, cloud-dependent, supervised Deep Learning paradigm in favor of an **unsupervised, vector-based morphometric pipeline** utilizing Google Open Buildings V3 footprints. 

### Core Achievements
- **Zero Label Dependency:** Fully unsupervised classification pipeline.
- **Cloud-Agnostic:** Operates exclusively on vector geometry, bypassing the optical imagery constraints that cripple CNNs in equatorial Africa.
- **Exceptional Stability:** Achieved a **Mean Pairwise ARI of 0.964** across a 50-seed K-Means ensemble, proving rigorous initialization-robustness.
- **Published Preprint:** Successfully authored a 7-page, IEEE-formatted academic preprint detailing the methodology and theoretical implications. 

### The Star Metrics
Rather than relying on black-box feature extractors, the pipeline engineers 15 physically interpretable spatial features. The classification is driven by two novel metrics:
1. **Orientation Entropy (Shannon $H$):** Distinguishes the directional disorder of organically grown informal fabric from the grid-aligned regularity of planned development.
2. **Density Ratios:** Captures the scale-dependent micro-clustering that characterizes informal settlements vs. scale-invariant planned spacing.
